Mixed the ingredients on the Saturday and let it rest overnight then stuffed the sausages Sunday.  Took about 4 hours.

Hung up around 75% of them and smoked the remainder for 2-3 hours.

## Notes / Possible adjustments.

The mince came in 4 10kg bags, the last bag had significantly more fat than the others.  Would have been good to get that more consistent as we used each bag for its own batch.
