## Recipe

20kg salami mince - coarse.  I think it was 14mm.  (11$/kg)

2 x 530 jars of Carmelina sweet pepper paste (9$ each)
400g crushed garlic
600g salt
300g crushed pepper
190g sweet paprika (~4$)
70g hot chilli flakes in half only
42mm tubes - pack from the butcher supply said 20-25kg.  It was plenty for 20kg. (~21$)

Mixed together in 10kg batches (one with chilli and one without) and refrigerated overnight in rubber tubs.  All up took about an hour to prepare, mix and clean.

Made the sausages in the morning, took 2-2.5 hours for preparation, making, cleaning and hanging.

Ended up with 56 sausages, 28 of each.

## Notes / Possible adjustments.

Felt like a fair bit of pepper.  Possibly a mix of crushed and coarse next time.
No extra fat used.
No water used.
Used cotton cooking twine to tie the ends.
Had a fair bit of tubes left, might have been good to be more generous with the amount left at the ends so they hang more securely.  1 dropped (so far)
